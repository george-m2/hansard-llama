      "Commons. The evolution of arguments concerning this issue can be traced back to the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's (UK) membership in the European Union (EU). Here is a summary of the key points and arguments made by various parties:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pre-referendum (2015-2016)**: The then-Prime Minister David Cameron and other pro-EU politicians argued that the UK would not leave the EU without a deal, and that the Northern Ireland border would remain largely unchanged. They claimed that the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) would be respected, and that the border would not be a hard border.\n",
      "2. **Post-referendum (2016-2017)**: After the Brexit vote, the UK Government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, began to develop a plan for leaving the EU. The plan, which became known as the \"Chequers plan,\" proposed a soft border with the Republic of Ireland, with the two countries working together to maintain a common travel area. This plan was met with skepticism from some pro-Brexit MPs, who argued that it would undermine the GFA and create a hard border.\n",
      "3. **March 2018**: In a speech at the Conservative Party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK would seek a \"new partnership\" with the EU, which would include a \"backstop\" to prevent a hard border. The backstop would ensure that there would be no physical border infrastructure or controls on the island of Ireland. This proposal was met with criticism from some pro-Brexit MPs, who argued that it would undermine the GFA and create a hard border.\n",
      "4. **June 2018**: The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, published a position paper on the Northern Ireland border, which proposed a \"special status\" for the region. The paper suggested that the region would have a different set of rules and regulations than the rest of the EU, but would still be subject to the same single market and customs union. This proposal was met with skepticism from some pro-Brexit MPs, who argued that it would undermine the GFA and create a hard border.\n",
      "5. **July 2018**: The UK Government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, released a white paper on the Northern Ireland border, which proposed a \"backstop\n",

      "\n",
      "* The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, which brought an end to the Troubles, was seen as a major achievement in the peace process.\n",
      "* The GFA created a soft border on the island of Ireland, with the UK and the Republic of Ireland working together to ensure the free movement of people, goods, and services.\n",
      "* The agreement also established the Common Travel Area (CTA), which allowed for visa-free travel between the two countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Brexit campaign (2016-2017)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* During the Brexit campaign, some Leave campaigners argued that the GFA would be rendered obsolete by Brexit, and that a hard border would be necessary to control immigration and prevent the free movement of people, goods, and services.\n",
      "* This argument was based on the idea that the GFA was a \"temporary\" solution that would not be needed once the UK left the EU.\n",
      "* Some Remain campaigners countered that the GFA was a crucial part of the peace process and that a hard border would be a step backward, potentially rekindling tensions and violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-referendum (2016-2019)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* In the aftermath of the referendum, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union, but would seek to maintain a close relationship with the EU.\n",
      "* The Irish Government, led by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, responded by stating that the GFA and the CTA would be maintained, and that the soft border would be preserved.\n",
      "* The European Union (EU) also reiterated its commitment to the GFA and the CTA, and that the soft border would be maintained.\n",
      "* The UK Government, however, insisted that the GFA would be reviewed and that a new arrangement would be sought, which would allow for a more comprehensive and modernized approach to the border.\n",

This is seen as a way to deter potential criminals and to ensure that those who commit heinous crimes are held accountable.\n",
      "3. **Increased Transparency and Accountability:** The PCSC aims to increase transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system by providing more information to the public about the criminal justice process. This includes the use of data and statistics to track the effectiveness of the system and to identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "4. **Improved Public Safety:** The PCSC seeks to improve public safety by introducing new measures to reduce the risk of reoffending, such as the use of electronic tags and GPS tracking. This is seen as a way to keep the public safe and to prevent further harm to individuals and communities.\n",
      "5. **Modernization of the Criminal Justice System:** The PCSC proposes to modernize the criminal justice system by introducing new technology and innovative solutions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

      "2. **Streamlined court processes**: The bill proposes to streamline court processes, reducing the time it takes to bring cases to trial and increasing the efficiency of the system. This would help to reduce the backlog of cases and speed up the justice process.\n",
      "3. **Increased protection for victims**: The PCSC includes measures to increase the protection for victims, including the creation of a new 'victims' charter' that sets out the support and services available to them. This would provide a better experience for those affected by crime.\n",
      "4. **Improved police powers**: The bill would give the police additional powers to tackle serious crimes, such as the power to stop and search individuals without a warrant. This would enable the police to more effectively target and apprehend criminals.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Fresh mandate**: The SNP argues that the 2014 independence referendum was a one-off event, and the result is not a reflection of the current will of the people. A new referendum would provide a fresh mandate, allowing the people to re-examine their decision and make a new choice.\n",
      "2. **Brexit context**: The SNP points out that the Brexit process has created a new political landscape, with the UK's departure from the EU having a significant impact on Scotland's economy, politics, and identity. A second independence referendum would take into account this new context, allowing the people to re-evaluate their options in light of the changing circumstances.\n",
      "3. **Changes in public opinion**: The SNP claims that public opinion on independence has shifted since the 2014 referendum, with more and more people supporting the idea of an independent Scotland. A second referendum would allow the people to re-assess their views and make a new choice based on the current state of public opinion.\n",
      "4. **New economic and financial prospects**: The SNP argues that the economic and financial prospects for an independent Scotland are now more promising than they were in 2014. A second referendum would take into account the new economic and financial prospects, allowing the people to re-evaluate their options in light of the changing circumstances.\n",
      "5. **Improved governance and institutions**: The SNP points out that the Scottish Government has made significant progress in building its own institutions and governing itself, making it a more viable and effective nation. A second referendum would take into account the improved governance and institutions, allowing the people to re-assess their views and make a new choice based on the current state of public opinion.\n",
      "6. **International recognition**: The SNP argues that international recognition of Scotland as a sovereign state would be a significant step forward, and a second referendum would help to achieve this goal. A second referendum would also help to build a stronger relationship with the rest of the world, including the EU, the US, and other nations.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Democracy and legitimacy**: The SNP argues that the 2014 independence referendum was a democratic exercise, and the will of the people should be respected. A second referendum would provide an opportunity for the people to re-affirm or re-examine their decision.\n",
      "2. **Brexit and the impact on Scotland**: The SNP claims that the Brexit process has created uncertainty and instability, which has had a significant impact on Scotland's economy, politics, and society. A second referendum would allow the people to consider the new circumstances and make an informed decision about Scotland's future.\n",
      "3. **Scotland's distinct identity and culture**: The SNP emphasizes the unique cultural and national identity of Scotland, arguing that it is essential to recognize and celebrate this distinctiveness. A second referendum would provide an opportunity for the people to reaffirm their commitment to Scotland's culture and heritage.\n",
      "4. **Economic and financial considerations**: The SNP highlights the economic and financial benefits of an independent Scotland, including the potential for greater control over its own resources, the ability to set its own fiscal policy, and the elimination of the Barnett formula, which allocates a portion of the UK's budget to Scotland.\n",
      "5. **International recognition and support**: The SNP points out that many international organizations, such as the European Union, the United Nations, and the International Olympic Committee, have recognized Scotland as a nation with its own distinct identity. A second referendum would provide an opportunity for the people to consider the new circumstances and make an informed decision about Scotland's future.\n",
      "6. **The need for a clear and decisive outcome**: The SNP argues that the 2014 referendum was too close, with 55.3% voting \"No\" and 44.7% voting \"Yes\". A second referendum would provide a clearer and more decisive outcome, allowing the people to move forward with a sense of certainty and confidence.\n",
      "7. **The role of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament**: The SNP highlights the role of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament in shaping the country's future. A second referendum would provide an opportunity for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament to demonstrate their commitment to the people and their will.\n",

The latest figures show that over 4 million people are waiting for treatment, with some patients waiting for over 18 months. Can you explain to this House why we're seeing such long wait times and what your plan is to address this issue?\n",

      "**Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Labour):** Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to address this important issue. (pauses) First, I want to acknowledge that the NHS is under significant pressure, with more people seeking care than ever before. However, I also want to be clear that our priority is to provide high-quality care to all who need it, regardless of their age, health status, or socioeconomic background.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chairman (Conservative):** But, Secretary of State, that's not the only reason. We've had multiple reports of patients being forced to wait for months, even years, for treatment. This is unacceptable. What specific steps will you take to reduce these wait times and ensure that patients receive the care they need in a timely manner?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Labour):** I understand the frustration and anxiety that comes with long wait times. (pauses) To address this, we're increasing the number of doctors and nurses working in the NHS, which will help to reduce the workload and improve patient access. We're also investing in new technology, such as digital consultations and remote monitoring, to make it easier for patients to access care from the comfort of their own homes. (pauses) Furthermore, we're working with our partners in the healthcare sector to develop new models of care that can better meet the needs of our patients. For example, we're exploring the use of community-based services, such as community health centers, to provide more accessible and convenient care options for patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chairman (Conservative):** That's all well and good, Secretary of State, but what about the existing capacity within the NHS? We know that the NHS is already at full capacity, so how do you plan to increase capacity without adding more resources? And what about the impact on staff morale and patient satisfaction when patients have to wait for so long?\n",

      "**Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Conservative Party):** \"Thank you, thank you. I understand the concerns about NHS waiting times, and I want to assure this House that we take these issues very seriously. We have made significant progress in reducing waiting times, and our latest data shows that the average wait time for an appointment with a specialist is now 18 weeks, down from 22 weeks just a year ago. However, I acknowledge that there is still more work to be done, and we are committed to continuing to reduce waiting times and improving patient care.\n",

We are working to address these underlying issues, and we will continue to do so until we see the waiting times we all want to see.\n",

      "1. **Inequality and the cost of living crisis**: Dodds emphasized that the current economic system is not working for the many, but rather for the few. She highlighted the increasing inequality in the country, where the top 10% of the population hold more than 50% of the wealth, while the bottom 20% struggle to make ends meet. She argued that the cost of living crisis is a result of this systemic inequality.\n",
      "2. **Investment in public services and infrastructure**: Dodds proposed investing in public services and infrastructure, such as the National Health Service (NHS), education, and transportation, to create a more equitable and sustainable economy. She argued that these investments would not only benefit the many, but also create jobs and stimulate the economy.\n",
      "3. **Addressing the climate emergency**: Dodds emphasized the need to address the climate emergency, which she described as a \"code red\" for the planet. She proposed a range of measures to reduce carbon emissions, including a target to reach net-zero by 2040, and a plan to create a green new deal for the UK.\n",
      "4. **Taxation and corporate accountability**: Dodds called for a fairer tax system, where corporations pay their fair share of taxes. She proposed a range of measures, including a windfall tax on unearned wealth, to ensure that corporations contribute to the public purse.\n",
      "5. **A more equal and just society**: Dodds concluded by emphasizing the need for a more equal and just society, where everyone has an opportunity to thrive. She argued that the current economic system is not designed to deliver this, and that the Labour Party's alternative budget is a step towards creating a more just and equal society.\n",

He argued that this is not a natural phenomenon, but rather a result of policy choices that have exacerbated inequality.\n",
      "2. **Economic growth and productivity**: McDonnell emphasized the need for a more sustainable and inclusive approach to economic growth, which would focus on increasing productivity and reducing income inequality. He argued that the current system is not delivering for the many, and that a more equal society would be more likely to achieve high levels of economic growth.\n",

He argued that these investments would not only benefit the many, but also create a more productive and competitive economy.\n",

      "5. **Debt and the national debt**: McDonnell acknowledged the national debt, but argued that it is a manageable issue if managed properly. He suggested that the government should prioritize investing in public services and infrastructure, and that the national debt should not be used as an excuse for austerity measures.\n",
      "6. **Productive and creative industries**: McDonnell emphasized the importance of supporting productive and creative industries, such as the arts, culture, and innovation. He argued that these sectors are crucial for the future of the UK, and that they require targeted support to thrive.\n",
      "7. **Trade and international cooperation**: McDonnell highlighted the importance of trade and international cooperation, particularly in the context of Brexit.

The government recognized that many businesses, particularly those in the hospitality, tourism, and retail sectors, would be severely affected by the pandemic and may not have been able to continue operating without some form of support.\n",
      "2. **Job preservation**: The scheme was designed to help employers keep their staff on the payroll, even if they could not work due to the pandemic. This would help to preserve jobs, reduce the risk of long-term unemployment, and provide a safety net for employees who might otherwise have been made redundant.\n",
      "3. **Support for the self-employed**: The furlough scheme also included a separate system for self-employed individuals, such as freelancers, contractors, and small business owners, who do not have access to traditional employment benefits. This was an important consideration, as many self-employed individuals were struggling to make a living due to the pandemic.\n",
      "4. **Protection for vulnerable workers**: The scheme was also designed to protect vulnerable workers, such as those with disabilities, carers, and those with family responsibilities, who may have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.\n",
      "5. **Fairness and equity**: The government emphasized the need for fairness and equity in its response to the pandemic. The furlough scheme was seen as a way to ensure that all employees, regardless of their employment status, had some form of support during this difficult time.\n",
      "6. **Flexibility and adaptability**: The scheme was designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing employers to adjust their workforce according to their needs. This flexibility was seen as essential, as the pandemic was an unprecedented event, and the government needed to be able to respond quickly and effectively.\n",
      "\n",

By allowing employers to keep their staff on the payroll, even if they were not working, the scheme aimed to prevent job losses and maintain business continuity.\n",
      "2. **Supporting workers' incomes**: The scheme ensured that employees would continue to receive 80% of their salary, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, while being furloughed. This meant that workers could still meet their financial obligations, such as rent and mortgage payments, despite the reduced income.\n",
      "3. **Preventing a jobs crisis**: The furlough scheme was seen as a key measure to prevent a jobs crisis, which could have led to a significant increase in unemployment and a decline in consumer spending. By keeping people in work, the scheme aimed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy.\n",
      "4. **Supporting the most vulnerable**: The scheme was also designed to support the most vulnerable members of society, including low-income families, the self-employed, and those with pre-existing health conditions. The furlough scheme helped to ensure that these individuals received the support they needed to get through the pandemic.\n",
      "5. **Encouraging business investment**: The furlough scheme was also seen as a way to encourage business investment, as it allowed companies to retain their workforce and continue to operate, even if at a reduced capacity. This helped to maintain the overall health of the economy and reduce the risk of long-term damage.\n",
